# OSSEC
OSSEC is an open source intrusion detection and file integrity checking tool, produced by the OSSEC Project Team. Information including the official documentation, which is not updated, and slowly released, at https://www.ossec.net.
OSSEC works on a manager - agent infrastructer, working cross OS, allowing you to have a Linux manager that handles Windows Agents etc. It boasts a level of PCI compliance, works fantastically at alerting and pushing information to the admin. Allows the user to select files on the system that they want to ensure the integrity of, checks for different levels of intrusion and communicates operation 

I noticed a general lack of OSSEC documentation/information, when I was initially learning, and tinkering with the tool, so this is a introduction and information on my current dealings, experiences, and procedures with setting up and running OSSEC. The largest downfall of OSSEC at this point is the lack of documentation, their documentation always seems to be behind the curve. The development speed is not rapid, but the documentation speed is even slower, and the quality is pretty bad.
